                    Before I start to learn Web Developing, I already learnt only the basic HTML and some CSS at that time and that was way back 2008. After 5 years, I came to research about thins like HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript. Little did I know this was bare minimum needed for web development, and actual process went much deeper than that. So here I would like to share my learning process about the past years.

                    My training started at searching youtube tutorials. HTML was updated to HTML3 and CSS which you could link to another file. I was offered a job to Ontario, Canada. Sadly, I rejected it because my Mom just finished her "6 ByPass Heart Surgery" and it's a long distance from Regina to Ontario. It was a hard decision, but I choose my family(We have this Filipino Culture that family's stay together lives together).

                        I stopped chasing Web Development. Then, focus as a professional DOTA2(Defense of The Ancient 2) which have big prizepool money of millions of dollars. I joined into a professional team which leads us to some major leagues and hoping for the big major tournament called the "The International". The undergo trainings through public match and some minor tournaments. Sadly again, all my time is conflict to the team schedule. I have full time work at Tim Hortons(Underpay job restaurant) and I have to give a ride for my Mom, for her daily check-up for her recently surgery.
